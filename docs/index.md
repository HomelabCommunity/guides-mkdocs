# Welcome to Homelab Guides

This site is a Homelab community collaboration effort to bring useful guides and resources into one central place.
We are not the source of truth on any topic. However, the guides here can be used as functional documentation for those who don't wish to spend an eternity in official product documentation or terrible YouTube videos.
